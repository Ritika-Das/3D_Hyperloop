# 3D_Hyperloop
This repository contains the 3D models developed for better visualization of a smart mobility system Hyperloop, first publicly mentioned the Hyperloop by Elon Musk in 2012.
The passengers will be boarding the HyperPod.

Welcome dear reader!

Here I have included 3D models for the Hyperloop Tube, HyperPod(pending), Solar Panel, Vacuum Pump with Pressure Gauge and the Ground separately, which can be put together to recreate the final 3D Hyperloop system.
The 3D models (.glb files) can be opened by the following softwares:

- 3D Viewer (Recommended) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-viewer/9nblggh42ths#activetab=pivot:overviewtab
- Paint 3D https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99?activetab=pivot:overviewtab

The actual 3D model of the final Hyperloop model is of 63.9 MB (44.5 MB after compressing) and the 3D model of the Hyperpod is of 42.5 MB (25.4 after compressing), i.e. both well over the GitHub limit of 25 MB, therefore I would be uploading Video versions of the same shortly.
